First basic website consisting of food recipes to ingrain core HTML practices

This  barebones HTML website will consist of a series of basic recipes in order to demonstrate and ingrain fundamental dev practices using the HTML language. 

I will begin by creating a boiler-plate from memory. The contents of the website will include a main index page which will link to a few different recipes. I will be making use of different headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists.
